## Why Pyxel?

1. It's very simple to learn (for pros & newbies) (I've made a game in 4 hours! in pure python!)
2. Has many simple examples to copy&edit
3. Has a nice ascii font
4. 8bit sound generator is amazing
5. It's fast (using opengl)
6. Nice to learn programming in python

## Advantages

* Very simple API - you can learn it in one day
* Documentation is a 1 file (README file in github)
* sprites support
* basic shapes drawing support
* 8 bit music / sound
* tilemaps
* built in sprite / map / music editor (But I haven't used it)

## Limitations (by design or not)

* Documentation doesn't have examples directly
* Documentation doesn't describe arguments and what functions/methods do.
* Supports only 16 colors (image assets too!)
* Has a limited banks with sounds and images
* Doesn't have a collision system
* 256Ã—256 screen size (with autoscalling so don't worry)
* No rotating / mirroring sprites
* No particles system
* Random bugs like segmentation fault or floating point error :-(
