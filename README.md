## Web version

[click](https://firemark.github.io/pyxel-prelection)

## Install

Requires `libsdl2-dev` and [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/).

In this directory:

```bash
pipx install -e .
pyxel-prelection-game
```

## Why Pyxel?

1. It's very simple to learn (for pro & newbies) (I've made a game in 4 hours! in pure python!)
2. Has many simple examples to copy&edit
3. Has a nice ascii font
4. 8bit sound generator is amazing
5. It's fast (using opengl, sdl2 in rust)
6. Nice to learn programming in python

## Advantages

* Very simple API - you can learn it in one day
* Documentation is a 1 file (README file in github)
* sprites support
* basic shapes drawing support
* 8 bit music / sound
* tilemaps
* built in sprite / map / music editor (But I haven't used it)

## Limitations (by design or not)

* Documentation doesn't have examples directly
* Documentation doesn't describe arguments and what functions/methods do.
* Supports only 16 colors (image assets too!)
* Has a limited banks with sounds and images
* Doesn't have a collision system
* 256Ã—256 screen size (with autoscalling so don't worry)
* No rotating / mirroring sprites
* No particles system
* Random bugs like segmentation fault or floating point error :-(

## Conclusion

* It's not unreal or unity engine
* It's not game maker too (But is very similar to first versions of game maker)
* It's a lot of fun!
* In short time we can make a nice, simple game
* I love 8 bit so much <3
* A good way to learn python and programming
