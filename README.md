## Why Pixel?

1. It's very simple to learn (for pro & newbies) (I made a game in 4 hours! in pure python!)
2. Have a many simple examples to copy&edit
3. Have a nice ascii font
4. 8bit sound generator is amazing
5. It's fast (using opengl)
6. Nice to learn programming in python

## Advantages

* Very simple API - you can learn in one day
* Documentation is a 1 file (README file in github)
* sprites support
* basic shapes drawing support
* 8 bit music / sound
* tilemaps
* bultin sprite / map / music editor (But I didn't used)

## Items

Assets: https://guardian5.itch.io/blue-green-and-red-spacecraft-asset (Thx!!)

Sound: Randomized

Engine: [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)

## Limits (special or not)

* Documentation don't have a examples directly
* Documentation don't describe arguments and what function/method do.
* Support only 16 colors (image assets too!)
* Have a limited banks with sounds and images
* Don't have a collision system
* 256Ã—256 screen size (with autoscalling so don't worry)
* Rotating / mirroring sprites
* No particles system
* Random bugs like segmentation fault or floating point error :-(

9. [add spawning enemies](https://github.com/firemark/pyxel-prelection/commit/4de16bc)
10. [add music (OMG!)](https://github.com/firemark/pyxel-prelection/commit/fa7fe11)
11. [add animations](https://github.com/firemark/pyxel-prelection/commit/db30b07)
12. [add background](https://github.com/firemark/pyxel-prelection/commit/9aa0904)
13. [support gamepad](https://github.com/firemark/pyxel-prelection/commit/18a3bf2)
14. [improving gameplay](https://github.com/firemark/pyxel-prelection/commit/cbf9ac2)

## Conclusion

* is not a unreal or unity engine
* is not a game maker too (But is very similar to first versions of game maker)
* Makes fun!
* In small amount of time we can make a nice, simple game
* I love 8 bit so much <3
* The good way to learn python and programming
